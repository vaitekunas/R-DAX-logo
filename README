This is just a simple R-script to create a couple of 
graphs based on financial/macroeconomic data, that I 
could use as a logo or background images on my new 
blog (vaitekunas.com).

These models have no real ability to explain financial 
markets - this is just an exercise in R :)

	Running this thing
#----------------------------------------------------#
    - If you like, unfortunately, me run this code on
      a windows machine, you'll have to do it in "admi-
      nistrator mode", because in case some packages
      have to be installed, C:\Program Files\... is not
      writable to non-administrator users (like apps).
    - main.R contains variable "main_R_path".
      Change this path to where main.R is located.
